### Hi, I am Jing ðŸ‘‹


I am a Full Stack Software Engineer specializing in JavaScript. Currently, I am pursuing an M.S in Computer Science. and will graduate Dec. 2020. I achieved a Ph.D. degree in the field of Materials Science and as a former research scientist and now as a software engineer, I thoroughly enjoy professions that involve problem-solving, attention to detail, and critical thinking. I am passionate about the step by step process of building something to solve real-life problems.

I have a strong background in building web apps with Javascript, React+Hooks, Node.js, Express, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and AWS. I think web applications will be our future because of its compatibility and portability. 

Some of the fun projects I've done:
Kitchen Master: https://github.com/jchen0506/KitchenMaster (on-going project, more features coming on the way!)
Camp Aang: https://github.com/hrr46-fec-aang/photoservice
Katar-a Center: https://github.com/hrr46-fec-aang/photoservice

While I am not coding, I love cooking and exploring different recipes which inspired me to build a web app for recipe searching. While I keep adding new features to my recipe app, I am seeking full-time software engineering positions
